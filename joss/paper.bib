	abstract = {Reflected light from planetary surfaces provides information, including mineral/ice compositions and grain sizes, by study of albedo and absorption features as a function of wavelength. However, deconvolving the compositional signal in spectra is complicated by the nonuniqueness of the inverse problem. Trade-offs between mineral abundances and grain sizes in setting reflectance, instrument noise, and systematic errors in the forward model are potential sources of uncertainty, which are often unquantified. Here we adopt a Bayesian implementation of the Hapke model to determine sets of acceptable-fit mineral assemblages, as opposed to single best fit solutions. We quantify errors and uncertainties in mineral abundances and grain sizes that arise from instrument noise, compositional end members, optical constants, and systematic forward model errors for two suites of ternary mixtures (olivine-enstatite-anorthite and olivine-nontronite-basaltic glass) in a series of six experiments in the visible-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) wavelength range. We show that grain sizes are generally poorly constrained from VSWIR spectroscopy. Abundance and grain size trade-offs lead to typical abundance errors of ≤1 wt \% (occasionally up to 5 wt \%), while 3\% noise in the data increases errors by up to 2 wt \%. Systematic errors further increase inaccuracies by a factor of 4. Finally, phases with low spectral contrast or inaccurate optical constants can further increase errors. Overall, typical errors in abundance are {\textless}10\%, but sometimes significantly increase for specific mixtures, prone to abundance/grain-size trade-offs that lead to high unmixing uncertainties. These results highlight the need for probabilistic approaches to remote determination of planetary surface composition.},

In this study, we derive a new set of optical constants for olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene using radiative transfer equations that include soil porosity and the opposition effect. Based on the new optical constants, we develop a mineral abundance and Mg\# unmixing model, and build a spectral library composed of mineral mixtures of plagioclase, olivine, low-Ca pyroxene (LCP) and high-Ca pyroxene (HCP), and Mg\# ranging within 40–90. The accuracy of this model in estimating mineral abundance and chemistry is better than 3 vol\% for olivine, LCP and HCP, better than 6 vol\% for plagioclase, and better than 10 for Mg\#. This model is validated using forward and inverse modeling. For the forward modeling, we reproduce the spectra of powdered pure minerals and Lunar Sample Characterization Consortium (LSCC) lunar soils, and the modeled spectra are consistent with those measured in the laboratory. For the inverse modeling, we determined mineral abundances and Mg\# of 19 LSCC soil spectra by searching the best match to the spectral library. The modeled mineral abundances of LSCC soils are consistent with those measured by X-ray digital imaging. We derived a global Mg\# map using our model and Moon Mineralogy Mapper images, and our Mg\# map shows a peak concentration at 70, consistent with that measured by the Lunar Prospector gamma-ray spectrometer.},

	abstract = {The surface properties of the icy bodies in the saturnian system have been investigated by means of the Cassini-VIMS (Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) hyperspectral imager which operates in the 0.35–5.1μm wavelength range. In particular, we have analyzed 111 full disk hyperspectral images of Rhea ranging in solar phase between 0.08° and 109.8°. These data have been previously analyzed by Filacchione et al. (Filacchione, G. et al. [2007]. Icarus 186, 259–290; Filacchione, G. et al. [2010]. Icarus 206, 507–523) to study, adopting various “spectral indicators” (such as spectral slopes, band depth, and continuum level), the relations among various saturnian satellites. As a further step we proceed in this paper to a quantitative evaluation of the physical parameters determining the spectrophotometric properties of Rhea’s surface. To do this we have applied Hapke (Hapke, B. [1993]. Theory of Reflectance and Emittance Spectroscopy, Topics in Remote Sensing: 3. Springer, Berlin) IMSA model (Isotropic Multiple Scattering Approximation) which allow us to model the phase function at VIS–IR (visible–infrared) wavelengths as well as the spectra taking into account various types of mixtures of surface materials. Thanks to this method we have been able to constrain the size of water ice particles covering the surface, the amount of organic contaminants, the large scale surface roughness and the opposition effect surge. From our analysis it appears that wavelength dependent parameters, e.g. opposition surge width (h) and single-particle phase function parameters (b,v), are strongly correlated to the estimated single-scattering albedo of particles. For Rhea the best fit solution is obtained by assuming: (1) an intraparticle mixture of crystalline water ice and a small amount (0.4\%) of Triton tholin; (2) a monodisperse grain size distribution having a particle diameter am=38μm; and (3) a surface roughness parameter value of 33°. The study of phase function shows that both shadow hiding and coherent backscattering contribute to the opposition surge. This study represents the first attempt, in the case of Rhea, to join the spectral and the photometric analysis. The surface model we derived gives a good quantitative description of both spectrum and phase curve of the satellite. The same approach and model, with appropriate modifications, shall be applied to VIMS data of the other icy satellites of Saturn, in order to reveal similarities and differences in the surface characteristics to understand how these bodies interact with their environment.},

	abstract = {The surface of Mars has a high morphological and mineralogical diversity due to the intricacy of external, internal processes, and exchanges with the atmosphere, the hydrosphere and the cryosphere. In particular, liquid water played an important role in surface evolution. However, the origin, duration and intensity of those wet events have been highly debated, especially in the clay-bearing geological units. Similarly, questions still remain about magma crystallization and volatile quantity of the dominant basaltic crust. In this work, six sites having hydrated minerals, salts and basaltic signatures (i.e., Mawrth Vallis, Holden crater, Eberswalde crater, Capri mensa, Eridania basin, Terra Sirenum) are investigated in order to better characterize the geological processes responsible for their formation and evolution (e.g., fluvial, lacustrine, in situ weathering, evaporitic, volcanic and aeolian processes). For that purpose, we use orbital multi-angular measurements from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument on-board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft to analyze the manner in which light is scattered by the surface materials (photometry) in the near-infrared range (at 750nm). The surface bidirectional reflectance depends on the composition but also on the surface microtexture such as the grain size distribution, morphology, internal structure and surface roughness, tracers of the geological processes. The Hapke semi-analytical model of radiative transfer in granular medium is used to model the surface bidirectional reflectance estimated at 750nm from the orbital measurements after an atmospheric correction. The model depends on different radiative properties (e.g., single scattering albedo, grain phase function and regolith roughness) related to the surface composition and microtexture. In particular previous laboratory works showed that the particle phase function parameters, which describe the characteristics of the volume scattering, are sensitive to the grain morphology and internal structure. The surface material photometric parameters estimated from the CRISM multi-angular observations at 750nm are compared to the geological units in order to better characterize the geological processes. The photometric results show a high diversity of surface scattering behaviors (from a broad and backward scattering behavior to a narrow and forward scattering behavior) that suggests a high diversity of surface microtexture. A narrow forward scattering behavior has been detected for the first time from martian orbital data and observed in peculiar regions dominated by salt-bearing and clay-bearing materials. Hence the martian photometric results suggest that Mars experimented varied geological processes still preserved in the material microtexture. This study also demonstrates that these properties provide complementary information to mineralogy and geomorphology to better constrain the geological processes.},

	abstract = {This project examines the different approaches which deal with the theory of radiative transfer on atmosphereless bodies. We present the relative merits of two scattering theories based on the equivalent slab model: the extensively used Hapke theory (Hapke 1981, J. Geophys. Res.86, 3039–3054) and the Shkuratov theory (Shkuratov et al. 1999, Icarus141, 132–155). We found that their main difference is the role of the phase function of individual particles of regolith, which is predicted (and generally forward directed) in the case of the Shkuratov model instead of being a free parameter as formulated in the Hapke model. We also emphasize that different assumptions as to the manner in which different constituents are physically mixed in either model have a substantial effect on the synthetic spectra inferred. This leads to a significant extension of the validity of Hapke's or similar practical approaches to areas where these approaches are valid. We used two objects (the Centaurs 5145 Pholus and 8405 Asbolus) as examples. Previous modeling of the spectra of these two bodies with the Hapke approach gave suspect results in terms of the derived grain sizes, which were smaller than the wavelength, violating key assumptions of the model (Cruikshank et al. 1998, Icarus135, 389–407 for Pholus; Barucci et al. 2000, Astron. Astrophys.357, L53–56 for Asbolus). We considered several different types of powdered surfaces to interpret the surface composition of these two Centaurs. The effect of fine-scale contamination of water ice grains by small amounts of carbon and/or tholins is also explored. We can explain the strong red color and the rich near-infrared spectral signatures of Pholus using a five-component surface (contaminated water ice, amorphous carbon, Titan tholin, olivine, and methanol ice) where the grain sizes are consistent with the model assumptions. These components are similar to those inferred by Cruikshank et al. (1998), but we obtain very different grain sizes and relative abundances. For example, we obtain a relative abundance of water ice on the surface of Pholus of about 40\% instead of 6\% found with the Hapke model. Organic and carbonaceous components change by similar amounts. In the case of Asbolus, a tholin and amorphous carbon areal mixture can reproduce the spectrum, with water remaining at 9\% or less. Using the albedo published by Fernandez et al. (2002, Astron. J.123, 1050–1055) which is higher than most workers assume for Centaurs and Kuiper belt objects, a surface composition similar to that of Pholus is found. It appears that model-based uncertainties in relative compositions must be regarded with more attention.},

Multiple scattering and mutual shadowing are taken into account. Analytic expressions for the following quantities are found: bidirectional reflectance, radiance factor, radiance coefficient, normal, hemispherical, Bond, and physical albedos, integral phase function, phase integral, and limb-darkening profile. Scattering functions for mixtures can be calculated, as well as corrections for comparing experimental laboratory transmission or reflection spectra with observational planetary spectra. An expression for the scattering efficiency of an irregular particle large compared with the wavelength is derived. For closely spaced, nonopaque particles this efficiency is approximated by (1 + αDe)−l, where α is the true absorption coefficient and De is an effective particle diameter of the order of twice the mean particle size. For monomineralic surfaces it is shown that α = ( 1 − w)/wDe, where w is the single-scattering albedo and can be determined from reflectance measurements of a powder, so that α may be calculated from reflectance. This theory should be useful for interpretations of reflectance spectroscopy of laboratory surfaces and photometry of solar system objects. From photometric observations of a body the following may be estimated: average single-scattering albedo, average particle phase function, average macroscopic slope, and porosity.},

	abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy is enabling precise measurements of atmospheric H2O abundances for numerous giant exoplanets. For hot Jupiters, relating H2O abundances to metallicities provides a powerful probe of their formation conditions. However, metallicity measurements for Neptune-mass exoplanets are only now becoming viable. Exo-Neptunes are expected to possess super-solar metallicities from accretion of H2O-rich and solid-rich planetesimals. However, initial investigations into the exo-Neptune HAT-P-26b suggested a significantly lower metallicity than predicted by the core-accretion theory of planetary formation and solar system expectations from Uranus and Neptune. Here, we report an extensive atmospheric retrieval analysis of HAT-P-26b, combining all available observations, to reveal its composition, temperature structure, and cloud properties. Our analysis reveals an atmosphere containing 1.5(+2.1)(-0.9)\% H2O, an O/H of 18.1(+25.9)(-11.3)x solar, and C/O {\textless} 0.33 (to 2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$). This updated metallicity, the most precise exo-Neptune metallicity reported to date, suggests a formation history with significant planetesimal accretion, albeit below that of Uranus and Neptune. We additionally report evidence for metal hydrides at 4.1\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence. Potential candidates are identified as TiH (3.6\${\textbackslash}sigma\$), CrH (2.1\${\textbackslash}sigma\$), or ScH (1.8\${\textbackslash}sigma\$). Maintaining gas-phase metal hydrides at the derived temperature ({\textasciitilde}560 K) necessitates strong disequilibrium processes or external replenishment. Finally, we simulate the JWST Guaranteed Time Observations for HAT-P-26b. Assuming a composition consistent with current observations, we predict JWST can detect H2O (at 29\${\textbackslash}sigma\$), CH4 (6.2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$), CO2 (13\${\textbackslash}sigma\$), and CO (3.7\${\textbackslash}sigma\$), improving metallicity and C/O precision to 0.2 dex and 0.35 dex. Furthermore, NIRISS observations could detect several metal hydrides at {\textgreater}5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence.},

	abstract = {We use radiative transfer (RT) models, based upon the Hapke (1993) model, to estimate the imaginary refractive index of magnetite from laboratory reflectance measurements. We used a RT program coupled with a least-squares algorithm to fit measured reflectance data using complex refractive indices of magnetite estimated here and literature values. We included differing representations of the grain size distribution for modeling the measured reflectance of the magnetite samples. Best-fitting models were obtained when using the complex indices of refraction estimated from a specific grain size fraction to fit the same grain size of reflectance data. Magnetite complex refractive indices taken from reported literature studies resulted in the poorest fits to the measured reflectance data. We investigated the multiple-scattering behavior of magnetite using Fresnel's equation and complex refractive indices from literature values and our own estimates. For both we found the reflection coefficient is {\textless}1\% after four reflections suggesting that multiple scattering is minimal. We also calculated the transmission via the Beer-Lambert law using the same sets of refractive indices. For both, the initial interface transmission had a comparable value near 80\%. However, as the distance through the material increases the discrepancy between the two refractive indices had substantial influence. For the literature values the transmission was reduced to {\textless}1\% after a distance of 8 μm at all wavelengths, whereas for the estimated values the transmission remained ≥75\% at this distance. Magnetite, when viewed in a petrographic thin section ({\textasciitilde}30 μm thick), is opaque. This suggests that the optical constants estimated via the Hapke approach are not realistic. We compared the calculated Fresnel reflectance using one literature value to the measured reflectances and found that the overall spectral shape was similar to the magnetite diffuse reflectance measurements. However, the magnetite diffuse reflectance is only 30–40\% of the calculated Fresnel reflectance. We speculate this may be due to the granular surfaces scattering light into a non-specular angle. Hapke-like models have been successfully applied for estimating optical constants of transparent materials. However, the present study finds that such models may not be appropriate for determining the optical constants of low-reflectance, opaque materials, as the results are not comparable to values of optical constants reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {Decades of observations of Europa's surface in the near-infrared (NIR), spanning spacecrafts like Galileo, Cassini and New Horizons, along with ground based observations, have revealed a rich mixture of species on Europa's surface. Adding to the NIR data of Europa, Juno spacecraft's spectrometer JIRAM has observed it in the 2–5 μm wavelength region. Here we present analysis of select spectra from this dataset, focusing on the two forms of water-ice - amorphous and crystalline. We were limited in our ability to include other dominant Europan species, like acid hydrate, due to unavailability of their optical constants over the entire JIRAM wavelength range. We also take this as an opportunity to present a novel Bayesian spectral inversion framework. Traditional spectral fitting methods, for example a grid-based search of parameter space, lack a systematic way to quantify detection significances of the species included in the model, statistically constrain surface properties and explore degenerecies of solution. Our Bayesian inference framework overcomes these shortcomings by confidently detecting amorphous and crystalline ice in the JIRAM data and permits probabilistic constraints on their compositions and average grain sizes to be obtained. We first validate our analysis framework using simulated spectra of amorphous and crystalline ice mixtures and a laboratory spectrum of crystalline ice. We next analyze the JIRAM data and, through Bayesian model comparisons, find that a two-component, intimately mixed model of amorphous and crystalline ice, henceforth referred to as TC-IM, is strongly preferred (at 26σ confidence) over a two-component model of the same materials but where their spectra are areally/linearly mixed. We also find that the TC-IM model is strongly preferred (at {\textgreater} 30σ confidence) over single-component models with only amorphous or crystalline ice, indicating the presence of both these phases of water ice in the data. Given the high SNR of the JIRAM data, abundances and grain sizes of amorphous and crystalline ice are very tightly constrained for the analysis with the TC-IM model. The solution corresponds to a mixture with a very large number density fraction (99.952−0.001+0.001 \%) of small (23.12−1.01+1.01 microns) amorphous ice grains, and a very small fraction (0.048−0.001+0.001 \%) of large (565.34−1.01+1.01 microns) crystalline ice grains. The overabundance of small amorphous ice grains we find is consistent with previous studies. The maximum-likelihood spectrum of the TC-IM model, however, is in tension with the data in the regions around 2.5 and 3.6 μm, and indicates the presence of non-ice components not currently included in our model. Our new technique therefore holds the promise of being able to identify these minor species hiding in Europan reflectance data in future work and constrain their abundances and physical properties.},

We used a collection of 57 images from Voyager’s Imaging Science System and New Horizons’ LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager for which we corrected the geometric metadata and projected every pixel to compute photometric information (reflectance and geometry of observation). We studied 20 areas scattered across the surface of Europa and estimated their photometric behavior using the Hapke radiative transfer model and a Bayesian framework in order to estimate their microphysical state. We have found that most of them were consistent with the bright backscattering behavior of Europa, already observed at a global scale, indicating the presence of grains maturated by space weathering. However, we have identified very bright areas showing a narrow forward scattering possibly indicating the presence of fresh deposits that could be attributed to recent cryovolcanism or jets. Overall, we showed that the photometry of Europa’s surface is more diverse than previously thought and so is its microphysical state.},

We observe a local reflectance minimum at 0.4 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m accompanied by an increase in reflectance from 0.35-0.3 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m in the spectra of Patroclus and Orus. We use the principles of Rayleigh scattering and geometric optics to develop a Hapke optical model to investigate whether this feature can be explained by the presence of submicroscopic grains on Trojan surfaces. The near ultraviolet "bump" feature can be explained by scattering due to fine-grained opaques (iron, amorphous carbon, or graphite) with grain sizes ranging from 20 - 80 nm.},

The simpler functions are needed to reduce the number of unknown parameters in photoclinometry, especially to distinguish the brightness variations of the surface materials from that due to the resolved topography. The limb darkening varies with the Hapke parameters for macroscopic roughness (θ), the single-scattering albedo (w), and the asymmetry factor of the particle phase function (g). Both of the simpler functions generally provide good matches to the limb darkening described by Hapke's function, but the lunar-Lambert function is superior when viewing angles are high and when (θ) is less than 30°. Although a nonunique solution for the Minnaert function at high phase angles has been described for smooth surfaces, the discrepancy decreases with increasing (θ) and virtually disappears when (θ) reaches 30° to 40°. The variation in limb darkening with w and g, pronounced for smooth surfaces, is reduced or eliminated when the Hapke parameters are in the range typical of most planetary surfaces; this result simplifies the problem of photoclinometry across terrains with variable surface materials. The Minnaert or lunar-Lambert fits to published Hapke models will give photoclinometric solutions that are very similar ({\textgreater}1° slope discrepancy) to the Hapke-function solutions for nearly all of the bodies and terrains thus far modeled by Hapke's function.},

Saari, F. E. Baird, and J. R. LeCompte (1969, Photometric Properties of Selected Lunar Features, NASA Contractor Report CR-1429) for dark, average, and bright lunar terrains. The lunar nearside geometric albedo and phase integral computed from the disk-integrated results are consistent with those of earlier investigators. The single scattering albedos of disk-resolved average and bright lunar terrains are systematically larger than that of lunar mare. Average particles in dark terrain regoliths are more backscattering than those in average and bright lunar terrains. The angular width of the opposition surge is greatest in dark terrains and is found to be best explained by modest differences in regolith particle-size distributions which might accompany the normal regolith maturation process. The total amplitude of the opposition surge for dark terrains is larger than for average and bright terrains. This result appears to be a consequence of the fact that in opaque particles, a larger fraction of singly scattered light at zero phase comes from first-surface reflection. The average subcentimeter macroscopic roughness of dark terrains is significantly lower than that of average and bright terrains. The relative magnitude of this difference is consistent with that obtained from radar measurements at decimeter scales.},

The complex compositional diversity of Pluto’s encounter hemisphere was revealed by the Ralph/LEISA infrared spectrometer on board of New Horizons. We present compositional maps of Pluto defining the spatial distribution of the abundance and textural properties of the volatiles methane and nitrogen ices and non-volatiles water ice and tholin. These results are obtained by applying a pixel-by-pixel Hapke radiative transfer model to the LEISA scans. Our analysis focuses mainly on the large scale latitudinal variations of methane and nitrogen ices and aims at setting observational constraints to volatile transport models. Specifically, we find three latitudinal bands: the first, enriched in methane, extends from the pole to 55°N, the second dominated by nitrogen, continues south to 35°N, and the third, composed again mainly of methane, reaches 20°N. We demonstrate that the distribution of volatiles across these surface units can be explained by differences in insolation over the past few decades. The latitudinal pattern is broken by Sputnik Planitia, a large reservoir of volatiles, with nitrogen playing the most important role. The physical properties of methane and nitrogen in this region are suggestive of the presence of a cold trap or possible volatile stratification. Furthermore our modeling results point to a possible sublimation transport of nitrogen from the northwest edge of Sputnik Planitia toward the south.},

We analyzed resolved images of Phobos acquired between 2004 and 2022 by the HRSC and the SRC cameras on board the Mars Express spacecraft. We performed photometric analysis using the Hapke model for both integrated and disk-resolved data. The Phobos phase function has a strong opposition effect due to shadow hiding, with an amplitude and a half-width of the opposition surge of 2.28\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.03 and 0.0573\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.0001, respectively. Overall, the surface of Phobos is dark, with a geometric albedo of 6.8 \% in the green filter and backscattering. We also found a surface porosity of 87{\textbackslash}\%, indicating the presence of a thick dust mantle or of fractal aggregates on the top surface. The SSA maps revealed high reflectance variability, with the blue unit area in the northeast Stickney rim being up to 65{\textbackslash}\% brighter than average, while the Stickney floor is among the darkest regions, with reflectance 10 to 20\% lower than average. Photometric modeling of the regions of interest selected in the red and blue units indicates that red unit terrains have a stronger opposition effect and a smaller SSA value than the blue ones, but they have similar porosity and backscattering properties. The HRSC data provide a unique investigation of the Phobos phase function and opposition surge, which is valuable information for the MMX observational planning. The Phobos opposition surge, surface porosity, phase integral, and spectral slope are very similar to the values observed for the comet 67P and for Jupiter family comets in general. Based on these similarities, we formulate a hypothesis that the Mars satellites might be the results of a binary or bilobated comet captured by Mars.},

	abstract = {We present a practical, timely, and effective radiative transfer algorithm, suitable for qualitative and quantitative analyses of high-resolution hyperspectral images of planetary surfaces in the visible and near-infrared domains. The bidirectional reflectance of a plane parallel, absorbing, scattering, and slightly stratified medium is generated. The local mean properties of scattering and absorption of such media are obtained apart, using semiempirical approaches. The functions which express the diffuse reflection and transmission behaviors of each homogeneous layer are then derived. For the multiple scattering term, we numerically resolve the equations appearing in the H, X and Y function method of radiative transfer, reducing the real phase function to a simplified one which can nevertheless be anisotropic. A better approach to the physical realism is obtained for the single and double scattering contributions, using their real analytical expressions. This contrasts with the Hapke model dedicated to homogeneous and semi-infinite media, where only an isotropic reduced phase function is adopted and the single scattering correction is applied. The bidirectional reflectance and the derived quantities (albedos) of an optically semi-infinite homogeneous medium are then easily derived from these quantities. For a stratified medium, a simple adding algorithm based on principles of invariance is presented. Compared to earlier and more complete theoretical developments, this model in most cases reproduces the dependence of the bidirectional reflectance according to the different geometrical and radiative parameters with a maximum of 10\% relative error. It leads to important gains of computation time and significantly extends the validity of Hapke's or similar practical approaches.},
